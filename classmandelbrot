#This is the function to create the julia fractal. 
#To me, what set apart the julia fractal from the mandelbrot fractal was that the c value was not equal to the originial point, instead being assigned a random value somewhere on the grid.
#Because of this, I made c a random value for every grid, creating a different shape every time. But because I could not know the most interesting parts of the pattern, I could not zoom in on any specific intersting part. Instead, the fractal zooms in on the center, as I wanted to frame out the usually empty black space on all edges.
