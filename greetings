import sys #imports information from command line
name = sys.argv[1] 

#sys.argv is the arguments defined after the program name.
#sys.argv is a list, starting with the program name at position 0. 
#using [1] makes it show only the argument in the second position 

print("Hello", name + "!")

# x = 5 (int)
# x = 5.7 (float)
# x = "c" (string)
# x + y (expression)
# x // y (floored division: divides then rounds down)
# x % y (modulus: divides and then gives remainder)
# x ** y (exponent)


#QUESTIONS
#1. The value is the program name, in this case it's "greetings"
#2. A rudementary way would be to actually count the number of arguments in the list. You could potentially store that value as an int, but that is just a guess.
#3. If you do not follow the expected number, you will obtain an error.
